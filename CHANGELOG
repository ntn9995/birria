### Developing

- Better help string formatting ?

## [0.1.0] - 2021-06-30

### Added

- Description printing
    - serve() accepts "description" as an optional string parameter.
    - help printing outputs the program name and the description as the first line.

### Bugs
- Description string includes the full path of the program if using console scripts
    - Intended behaviour is just to use the program name

## [0.0.2] - 2021-06-20

### Added

- Alias for optional arguments 
    - Help string also prints out aliases

### Bugfix
- Correctly match option string, only match for whole string now.

## [0.0.1] - 2021-06-18

### Added

- Basic features and functionalities
    - Required and optional arguments with type annotations
    - List typed arguments
    - Supported types: `int, float str, bool, list, List, List[str], List[int], List[float]`
    - '-', '+', '/' as valid prefixes for option string
    - Supports both snake-cased and dash-separated names as valid option strings
- Help string printing functionality.


### Bugs
- Option string matching is bad due to misconstructed regex
    - Accepts any matches (even a substring) instead of a whole string
    - "-b", "-bleh", "a-b" both counts as the same option string ("-b" is a
    substring in all of these cases)
